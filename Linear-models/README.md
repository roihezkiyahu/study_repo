## Linear Models
This directory contains my solutions to home assignments from the "Linear Models" course, an advanced course for statistics master's students. The course and hence the assignments cover a wide range of topics in linear models, providing practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

## Contents
The directory is organized into the following sub-directories:

* EX1 to EX5: These folders contain exercises that cover various aspects of linear models, including multiple linear regression, polynomial linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, PCA, PLS, nonlinear regression, and linear mixed models.

* EXAM: This folder contains my work related to the exam of the course.

## Learning Outcomes
Through these assignments, I have gained a deep understanding of linear models and their applications. This includes but is not limited to multiple and polynomial linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, PCA, PLS, nonlinear regression, and linear mixed models.
