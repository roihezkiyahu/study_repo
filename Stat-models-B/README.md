## Statistical Models B
This directory contains my solutions to exercises from the "Statistical Models B" course, an advanced undergraduate course. The course and hence the exercises cover a wide range of topics in statistical models, providing practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

## Contents
The directory is organized into the following sub-directories:

* EX1 to EX11: These folders contain exercises that cover various aspects of statistical models, including one-way and two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons (FDR, Bonferroni, etc.), random effect, fixed effect, mixed effect, linear mixed models, and logistic regression.
  
## Learning Outcomes
Through these exercises, I have gained a deep understanding of statistical models and their applications. This includes but is not limited to one-way and two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons (FDR, Bonferroni, etc.), random effect, fixed effect, mixed effect, linear mixed models, and logistic regression. As part of the course, I also gained hands-on experience with R for data analysis and modeling, utilizing libraries like ggplot, tidyverse, and tidymodels.
