this is a project i did as part of my bachelor's degree at Tel Aviv university

my role was to set up a platform to process the data from human robot interaction and then analyze it

we sought to understand how does the robot influnce the interaction using causality testing

I wrote a paper as part of the project which can be found in this repo

all code is written in python
