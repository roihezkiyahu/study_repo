# Advanced Statistical Theory

This directory contains my solutions to exercises from the "Advanced Statistical Theory" course, an advanced course for statistics master's students. The course and hence the exercises cover a wide range of topics in advanced statistical theory, providing practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

## Contents

The directory is organized into the following sub-directories:

- **EX_1 to EX_5**: These folders contain exercises that cover various aspects of advanced statistical theory, including minimal, complete and sufficient statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), M estimators, asymptotic statistics, convergence, consistency, kernel density estimations, Bayesian statistics, and decision theory.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these exercises, I have gained a deep understanding of advanced statistical theory and its applications. This includes but is not limited to minimal, complete and sufficient statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), M estimators, asymptotic statistics, convergence, consistency, kernel density estimations, Bayesian statistics, and decision theory.
