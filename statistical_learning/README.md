# Statistical Learning

This directory contains my solutions to home assignments from the "Statistical Learning" course, an advanced course for statistics master's students based on the book "Elements of Statistical Learning". The course and hence the assignments cover a wide range of topics in statistical learning, providing practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

## Contents

The directory is organized into the following sub-directories:

- **EX1 to EX4**: These folders contain exercises that cover various aspects of statistical learning, including curse of dimensionality, bias-variance tradeoff, selection of loss functions, basis expansions and kernels, linear methods, regularization (Ridge, Lasso), PCA, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, classification and regression trees, random forests, XGB, model assessment and selection (CV, AIC, BIC, Bootstrap methods), splines and polynomials, and deep learning and its relation to statistical learning.

- **EXAM**: This folder contains my work related to the exam of the course.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these assignments, I have gained a deep understanding of statistical learning and its applications. This includes but is not limited to curse of dimensionality, bias-variance tradeoff, selection of loss functions, basis expansions and kernels, linear methods, regularization (Ridge, Lasso), PCA, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, classification and regression trees, random forests, XGB, model assessment and selection (CV, AIC, BIC, Bootstrap methods), splines and polynomials, and deep learning and its relation to statistical learning.
