## Unsupervised Learning
This directory contains my practical solutions to home assignments from the "Unsupervised Learning" course, an advanced course for statistics master's students. The course and hence the exercises cover a wide range of topics in unsupervised learning, providing practical applications of the theoretical concepts.

## Contents
The directory is organized into the following sub-directories:

* EX2 and EX4: These folders contain exercises that cover various aspects of unsupervised learning, including dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, word embedding, clustering, metric learning, multi-modal data fusion, generative models, self-supervised learning, matrix completion, and anomaly detection.
  
## Learning Outcomes
Through these exercises, I have gained a deep understanding of unsupervised learning and its applications. This includes but is not limited to dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, word embedding, clustering, metric learning, multi-modal data fusion, generative models, self-supervised learning, matrix completion, and anomaly detection.
